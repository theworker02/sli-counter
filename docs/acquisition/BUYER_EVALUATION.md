# Buyer evaluation â€” sli-counter

## Goal

In 15â€“45 minutes, verify the Product builds or runs as documented and that proprietary notices are present.

## Steps

1. Confirm root `LICENSE` is proprietary and `ACQUISITION.md` exists.
2. Skim `README.md` install/run claims.
3. Execute:

```
```bash
deno add jsr:@theworker02/sli-counter
```
```ts
import { bump, ratioOf, report } from "@theworker02/sli-counter";

bump("good");
console.log(report(undefined, undefined, { slo: 0.99 }));
console.log(ratioOf({ good: 99, bad: 1 }));
```
```bash
git clone https://github.com/theworker02/sli-counter.git
cd sli-counter
node src/cli.js good
node src/cli.js report
```
```bash
node --test
```
```

4. Run tests if present (`npm test`, `pytest`, `cargo test`, `go test ./...`, etc.).
5. Record README vs observed behavior gaps in workpapers.

## Pass criteria

- [ ] Clone succeeds
- [ ] Documented happy path works **or** failure is explained
- [ ] Minimal path needs no surprise secrets
- [ ] License notices intact
